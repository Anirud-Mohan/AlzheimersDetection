    st.markdown("<p style='color: white; text-align: left;'>EMCI stands for Early Mild Cognitive Impairment, which is a subcategory of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). EMCI is characterized by subtle but measurable cognitive changes that may indicate the early stages of cognitive decline.</p>", unsafe_allow_html=True)
    st.markdown("<p style='color: white; text-align: left;'>EMCI is typically diagnosed through a combination of cognitive testing, medical history, and neurological examination. People with EMCI may experience difficulty with memory, language, attention, or problem-solving, but these changes are not severe enough to significantly impact daily activities or independence.</p>", unsafe_allow_html=True)
    st.markdown("<p style='color: white; text-align: left;'>Studies suggest that people with EMCI are at a higher risk of developing dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease, than those without cognitive impairment. However, not everyone with EMCI will progress to dementia, and some people may even experience improvements in cognitive function over time.</p>", unsafe_allow_html=True)
    st.markdown("<p style='color: white; text-align: left;'>Like MCI, there is currently no cure for EMCI, but there are treatments and interventions that can help slow down the progression of cognitive decline and improve quality of life. These may include medications, cognitive training, lifestyle changes, and management of underlying health conditions. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional if you or someone you know is experiencing symptoms of EMCI or other cognitive changes.</p>", unsafe_allow_html=True)
