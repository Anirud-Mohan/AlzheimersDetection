    st.markdown("<p style='color: white; text-align: left;'>MCI stands for Mild Cognitive Impairment, a neurological condition that affects cognitive functions such as memory, language, attention, and decision-making. MCI is considered to be a transitional stage between normal age-related cognitive changes and dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease.</p>", unsafe_allow_html=True)
    st.markdown("<p style='color: white; text-align: left;'>People with MCI have mild but noticeable changes in their cognitive abilities, but these changes are not severe enough to interfere with daily activities or independence. Common symptoms of MCI include forgetting recent events, difficulty finding words, trouble with complex tasks, and decreased ability to concentrate.</p>", unsafe_allow_html=True)
    st.markdown("<p style='color: white; text-align: left;'>Not everyone with MCI will develop dementia or Alzheimer's disease, but studies suggest that people with MCI are at a higher risk of developing these conditions than those without MCI. It is estimated that about 10-20% of people with MCI will progress to dementia each year, compared to 1-2% of the general population.</p>", unsafe_allow_html=True)
    st.markdown("<p style='color: white; text-align: left;'>There is currently no cure for MCI, but there are treatments and interventions that can help slow down the progression of the condition and improve quality of life. These may include medications, cognitive training, lifestyle changes (such as exercise and a healthy diet), and management of any underlying health conditions that may be contributing to cognitive decline. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional if you or someone you know is experiencing symptoms of MCI.</p>", unsafe_allow_html=True)
